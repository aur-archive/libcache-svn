command (+parameter1):
"-key" "DepotEncryptionKey" //this can be set before any other command

"-e" <FileOrDirectoryInCache> "outputpath" <parameter2> //extract single object from cache(gcf,ccf only)//parameter2: "-!fp" = do not extract with fullpath
"-eall" "outputpath" //extract all files in cache
"-emin" "outputpath" //extract minimal footprint files
"-eusrconf" "outputpath" //extract userconfig files

"-vc" <FileOrDirectoryInCache> //validate file or directory stored in cache (gcf,ccf only)
"-vf" "filepath" //validate file or directory stored on hard drive
"-vf" "sourcedir" "filepath" //use this if there are several files/dirs with the same name
"-vac" //validate all files in cache [gcf/ccf only]
"-vaf" //validate all files or directories stored on hard drive [gcf/ncf/ccf/cmf]

"-ap" "patch" "outputgcf" //create a updated version using the given patch (implies mounted files is the older gcf)
"-cp" "oldgcf" "patch" //creates the patch containing only updated files from oldgcf to mounted gcf (implies mounted gcf is thew newer file)

"-showtree" //displays all nodes in the cachefile

examples:
libcache mount "source 2007 shared models.gcf" "-gcf" "-eall" "/home/razor/Desktop/Projects/test" //extracts all files
